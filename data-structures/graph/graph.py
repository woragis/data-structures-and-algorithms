# networks
# types of graphs:
#   undirected graph, no edge orientation
#   directed graph / digraph, edges have direction
#   weighted graph, come in directed or undirected
# special graphs:
#   trees
#   directed acycled graphs DAGS
#   bipartite graph
#   complete graph

# shortest path algorithms:
#   BFS (unweighted graph)
#   Dijkstra's Algorithm
#   Bellman-Ford
#   Floyd-Warshall
#   A*
#   and many more

# Connectivity:
#   any search algorithm
#   DFS or BFS

# Negative cycles:
#   Bellman-Ford
#   Floyd-Warshall

# Strong Connected Components
#   Tarjan's Algorithm
#   Kosaraju's Algorithm

# Traveling salesman problem
#   Held-Karp
#   Branch and bound
#   and many aproximation algorithms

# Articulation points
